##Unit 4- Docker Compose: Overview
- Used to configure relationships between containers, as a container will often need to work with other containers.
- Used to save container run settings in an easy-to-read file
- Used to create one-line developer environment startups
- It is a two-part operation, consisting of:
	- YAML file with config for all relationships and dependencies (docker-compose.yaml).
Describes solutions for containers, networks, and volumes.
	- CLI tool , **docker-compose**, used for local dev/test automation using the YAML files.

##Docker Compose: YAML file (Format)

```
version: '3.1' # if no version is specified, then v1 is assumed. Recommend v2 minimum
services: # containers. same as docker run
 servicename: # a friendly name. this is also DNS name inside network
 image: # Optional if you use build:
 command: # Optional, replace the default CMD specified by the image
 environment: # Optional, same as -e in docker run
 volumes: # Optional, same as -v in docker run
 servicename2:
volumes: # Optional, same as docker volume create
networks: # Optional, same as docker network create
```

-
##Docker Compose: YAML file (example)

```
version: '2' # if no version is specified, then v1 is assumed. Recommend v2 minimum
services:
 wordpress:
 image: wordpress
 ports: #(same as using the “-p” option on the command line)
 - 8080:80
 environment: #(same as using the “-e” option on the command line)
 WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: mysql
 WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: wordpress
 WORDPRESS_DB_USER: example
 WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: examplePW
 volumes:
 - ./wordpress-data:/var/www/html
#(continued on next slide)
```

-
##Docker Compose: YAML file (example contin.)

```
#(continued from previous slide…)
 mysql:
 image: mariadb
 environment:
 MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: examplerootPW
 MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
 MYSQL_USER: example
 MYSQL_PASSWORD: examplePW
 volumes:
 - mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
 mysql-data:
```

#Unit 4: Docker Compose
###docker-compose and the CLI

-
##docker-compose CLI (basic commands)
**Most common commands:**

- `docker-compose up`: setup volumes/networks and start all containers
- `docker-compose down`: stop all containers and remove containers, volumes,
and networks (cleanup)

**Also:**

- `docker-compose ps`: shows you which containers are running
- `docker-compose top`: lists all the services running inside
- `docker-compose logs`: view logs when run is used with the `-d` option

##Lab: Compose File for a Multi-Container Service

Build a basic compose file for a **Drupal** content management system (CMS) website. See Docker Hub to
get the image info.

- Use **Drupal** image along with the **Postgres** image for the database. (Documentation on Hub as
well)
- Use **ports** to expose **Drupal** on **8080** so you can access in browser via **http://localhost:8080**
- Be sure to set the environment variable **POSTGRES_PASS** for postgres. You may also choose to
set a value for **POSTGRES_USER** and **POSTGRES_DB**, though not necessary, as they will be
"**postgres**" by default.
- Walk through Drupal installation in browser.
- Installation tip: Drupal will assume the DB host is **localhost**, however the proper name is the its
service name.
- Bonus action: Use volumes to store Drupal's unique data<br>
**(*will likely be a small file, roughly 10 or so lines)**

-
##Using Compose to Build
- Compose can also build your custom images
- If not found in cache, it will build them with docker-compose up.
- Use **docker-compose** build to rebuild the image.
- Useful for complex builds that have numerous variables or build arguments.

##Lab: Compose for Run-Time Image Building and Multi-Container Development

- This exercise covers building a custom Drupal image for local testing
- Compose, in this scenario is useful for testing apps, such as:
	- A user learning the Drupal admin UI
	- a software tester evaluating the performance of an app
- Start with Compose file from previous lab
- Make your **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml** in the directory
compose-lab-2
- Use the **README.md** in the directory for details
